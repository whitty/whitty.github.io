For pay I mostly work in embedded software which is a
word with almost no meaning.  I've worked in telecommunications,
medical, and audio-visual domains and on devices from 2K-12GB of RAM
and 1-16 cores depending on your definitions.  Apparently they all
have something in common that makes them embedded and other things not.

For those projects I code in "whatever is appropriate" - in reality
this means C++, shell, python, mostly.

I'm also a bit of a tools nerd - automated test, CI, build automation.

When I'm not being paid I muck around in ruby mostly because its
genuinely enjoyable to use.
